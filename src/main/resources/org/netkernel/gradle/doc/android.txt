=Android DEX=

Create Android compatible DEX bytecode jar files.

==dex==

The '''dex''' task will first run the regular ''build'' task on your module to create a standard Java build.

Once built successfully the task calls the Android Developer studio tool '''dx --dex''' to perform a bytecode conversion
of the built module to Android's DEX bytecode format.

You '''must''' have the ''dx'' build tool accesible on your path.

The dex task will covert the core module and any jar files contained in its lib/ directory.  All will be compiled
to DEX format. A DEX bytecode jar file is given the file extension of '''.dex.jar'''

Upon success you will find the original module jar file and a dex.jar file in the build/libs/ directory.

==Configuration==

You may provide an optional configuration argument '''gradle.ext.ANDROID_DX_SWITCHES' in your ''settings.gradle''
to supply additional command line switches for the '''dx''' tool.

In this example we set the --min-sdk-version switch

{java}
gradle.ext.ANDROID_DX_SWITCHES="--min-sdk-version=26"
{/java}
