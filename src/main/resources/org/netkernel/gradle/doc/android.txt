=Android DEX=

Create Android compatible DEX bytecode jar files.

==dex==

The '''dex''' task will first run the regular ''build'' task on your module to create a standard Java build.

Once built successfully the task calls the Android Developer studio tool '''d8''' to perform a bytecode conversion
of the built module to Android's DEX bytecode format.

You '''must''' have the ''d8'' build tool accesible on your path - its usually found in ''/Android/Sdk/build-tools/x.x.x/d8''

The dex task will covert the core module and any jar files contained in its lib/ directory.  All will be compiled
to DEX format. A DEX bytecode jar file is given the file extension of '''.dex.jar'''

Upon success you will find the original module jar file and a dex.jar file in the build/libs/ directory.

==Configuration==

You may provide an optional configuration argument '''gradle.ext.ANDROID_DX_SWITCHES' in your ''settings.gradle''
to supply additional command line switches for the '''dx''' tool.

In this example we set the --min-sdk-version switch

{java}
gradle.ext.ANDROID_D8_SWITCHES="--min-api 26"
{/java}
