To use the NetKernel plugin you need to supply some boilerplate to Gradle.  The following configuration
should be declared at the top of your ''build.gradle'' file...

{java}
//Apply the NetKernel plugin
apply plugin: 'netkernel'

//Provide this buildscript with repositories and dependencies to obtain the netkernel plugin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            url "https://maven.netkernel.org/netkernel-maven"
        }
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath group: 'urn.org.netkernel', name: 'gradle.plugin', version: '[2.3.3,)'
    }
}

netkernel {
//All configuration for netkernel plugin tasks goes here.
}
{/java}

The NetKernel plugin is hosted as a jar file in the official 1060 Research maven repository (https://maven.netkernel.org/netkernel-maven).  The ''buildscript''
declaration defines the ''repositories'' to use to find the plugin and its dependencies.  The ''apply'' statement instructs Gradle to instantiate and make
available the tasks provided by the NetKernel plugin.

The options for what can be configured in the '''netkernel { ... }''' closure are documented in the following sections.
